\section{Bug \#1: Email Field Validation Not Working Properly}

\bugtitle{Email Field Accepts Empty Input But Validates Incorrectly When Typing}

\subsection*{Description}
The email field on the student registration form has inconsistent validation behavior. When left completely empty, the form allows submission without any validation error. However, once a user starts typing anything in the field, validation is triggered and expects an email format, but accepts any text containing '@' regardless of domain validity, however if '+' is used in the imail for example like abc+xyz@gmail.com, its regarded as invalid.

\subsection*{Steps to Reproduce}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to \url{https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form}
    \item Leave the email field completely empty
    \item Fill out other required fields (First Name, Last Name, Gender, Mobile)
    \item Click Submit
    \item Observe that the form submits without validating the empty email
    \item Reload the page
    \item Start typing in the email field (e.g., "test")
    \item Notice validation appears requiring '@'
    \item Type "test@anything" with an invalid domain
    \item Observe the validation accepts this format
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Expected vs. Actual Behavior}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!40, title=Expected Behavior]
Email field should be validated whether empty or filled, and should only accept properly formatted email addresses with valid domains (e.g., @example.com, @gmail.com)
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!40, title=Actual Behavior]
Empty email field is not validated at all, and partial validation only begins once typing starts. The validation accepts any text with '@' regardless of domain validity.
\end{tcolorbox}
