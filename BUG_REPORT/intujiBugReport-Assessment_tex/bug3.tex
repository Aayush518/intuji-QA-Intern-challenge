\section{Bug \#3: Picture Upload Field Accepts Any File Type}

\bugtitle{Picture Upload Field Accepts Non-Image Files and Has Persistent Caching Issues}

\subsection*{Description}
The picture upload functionality has multiple issues:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It accepts any file type (PDFs, ZIP, WAV, etc.) instead of limiting to image formats
    \item The uploaded file persists in memory even when the form is reset or closed
    \item When the form is closed (via close button) and reopened without page refresh, and submitted without selecting a new picture, the previously uploaded file is still submitted despite the upload field appearing empty
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Steps to Reproduce}
\subsubsection*{For file type issue:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to \url{https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form}
    \item Click on the "Select picture" button
    \item Select a non-image file (e.g., PDF, ZIP, WAV)
    \item Observe that the file is accepted
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{For caching issue without page refresh:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Upload a picture to the form
    \item Click the Submit button
    \item When the confirmation modal appears, click the Close button
    \item Observe that all form fields are reset, including the file upload field (no filename is displayed)
    \item Without uploading a new file, click Submit again
    \item Observe that the previously uploaded file is still submitted even though no file appears to be selected
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{For caching issue with page refresh:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Upload a picture and submit the form
    \item Refresh the page
    \item Observe that the file upload field is properly reset (as expected)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Expected vs. Actual Behavior}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!40, title=Expected Behavior]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Picture upload should only accept image file types (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
    \item When the form is reset after submission (via Close button), all form data including the file upload should be completely cleared from memory
    \item A new submission after form reset should not include any previously uploaded files unless explicitly selected again
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!40, title=Actual Behavior]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any file type is accepted for upload
    \item When the form is reset via the Close button after submission, the file upload appears to be reset visually, but the file data persists in memory
    \item Form submissions after resetting (without page refresh) still include the previously uploaded file even though the file upload field appears empty
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
