\section{Bug \#4: Form Submits With Empty Required Fields}

\bugtitle{Form Submits Successfully With Multiple Empty Required Fields}

\subsection*{Description}
The form allows submission even when several fields that should logically be required are left empty:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Subjects field can be left completely empty
    \item Current Address field can be left empty
    \item Picture upload can be skipped entirely
    \item Hobbies checkboxes can all be left unselected
    \item State and City fields can both be left unselected
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Steps to Reproduce}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to \url{https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form}
    \item Fill only the minimum required fields (First Name, Last Name, Gender, Mobile Number)
    \item Leave all other fields empty:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Don't select any Subjects
        \item Leave Current Address blank
        \item Don't upload any Picture
        \item Don't select any Hobbies
        \item Don't select State or City
    \end{itemize}
    \item Click Submit
    \item Observe that the form submits successfully
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Expected vs. Actual Behavior}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!40, title=Expected Behavior]
If fields are crucial for the student registration process (like Subjects for a student), the form should validate them and prevent submission if they're empty
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=gray!40, title=Actual Behavior]
The form submits successfully even with multiple logically required fields left empty, resulting in incomplete student records
\end{tcolorbox}
